SoundCloud OAuth Demo
=====================

A sample Xcode project that demonstrates how to fetch an OAuth token via the SoundCloud API and display results from an authenitcated request.

Notes
-----

To run this demo you will need to [register a SoundCloud application](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new), which will give you a client ID and secret. You will then need to enter these details in the `MeViewController.swift` class to be able to get an OAuth token.
